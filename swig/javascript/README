Pocketsphinx is available in node with pocketsphinx module

https://www.npmjs.com/package/pocketsphinx

To install it type

   npm install -g pocketsphinx

then

   node test.js

Requirements include latest pocketsphinx, sphinxbase and swig 3.0

Current module simply wraps pocketsphinx API as described in our swig files, in the future
we might add asyncroneous extensions for the pocketsphinx API so recognition would not
block event loop.
