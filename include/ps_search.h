/**
 * @file ps_search.h User can configure several "search" objects with
 * different grammars and langauge models and switch them in runtime to
 * provide interactive experience for the user.
 *
 * There are different possible search modes:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>keyphrase - efficiently looks for keyphrase and ignores other speech. allows to configure detection threshold.</li>
 * <li>grammar - recognizes speech according to JSGF grammar. Unlike keyphrase grammar search doesn't ignore words which are not in grammar but tries to recognize them.</li>
 * <li>ngram/lm - recognizes natural speech with a language model.</li>
 * <li>allphone - recognizes phonemes with a phonetic language model.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each search has a name and can be referenced by a name, names are
 * application-specific. The function ps_set_search allows to activate
 * the search previously added by a name. Only single search can be
 * activated at time.
 *
 * To add the search one needs to point to the grammar/language model
 * describing the search. The location of the grammar is specific to the
 * application.
 *
 * The exact design of a searches depends on your application. For
 * example, you might want to listen for activation keyphrase first and once
 * keyphrase is recognized switch to ngram search to recognize actual
 * command. Once you recognized the command you can switch to grammar
 * search to recognize the confirmation and then switch back to keyphrase listening
 * mode to wait for another command.
 *
 * If only a simple recognition is required it is sufficient to add a single search or
 * just configure the required mode with configuration options.
