PocketSphinx 0.1

This is PocketSphinx, one of Carnegie Mellon University's open source
large vocabulary, speaker-independent continuous speech recognition
engine. Please see the LICENSE file for terms of use.

THIS IS A RESEARCH SYSTEM.  This is also an early release of a
research system.  We know the APIs and function names are likely to
change, and that several tools need to be made available to make this
all complete.  With your help and contributions, this can progress in
response to the needs and patches provided.

To compile:

-in a unix-like environment (such as linux, solaris etc):

--if you downloaded directly from the CVS repository, you need to do
this at least once to generate the "configure" file:

% ./autogen.sh

--if you downloaded the release version, or ran "autogen.sh" at least
once, then compile and install:

% ./configure
% make clean all
% make test
% make install

-in MS Windows (TM), under MS Visual C++ 6.0 (or better):

-load sphinx2.dsw (located at the top level directory)
-compile minimally the project 'pocketsphinx_continuous'

MS Visual Studio will build the executables under .\bin\Release or
.\bin\Debug (depending on the version you choose on MS Visual Studio),
and the libraries under .\lib\Release or .\lib\Build.

Test scripts are forthcoming for Windows.
