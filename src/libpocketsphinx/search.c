/*
 * search.c -- HMM-tree version
 * 
 * HISTORY
 *
 * $Log: search.c,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2006/05/23 18:45:01  dhuggins
 * re-importation
 *
 * Revision 1.17  2005/06/07 02:36:02  dhdfu
 * Forward-declaring functions inside functions apparently no longer
 * works in recent GCC versions (this code breaks on 3.3, 4.0).  No good
 * reason for it anyway...
 *
 * Revision 1.16  2005/05/24 20:55:24  rkm
 * Added -fsgbfs flag
 *
 * Revision 1.15  2005/01/20 15:11:47  rkm
 * Cleaned up pscr-related functions
 *
 * Revision 1.14  2004/12/10 16:48:56  rkm
 * Added continuous density acoustic model handling
 *
 * 
 * 01-Dec-2004	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University

 * 
 * Revision 1.13  2004/11/09 19:01:41  egouvea
 * Added Ravi's changes, which add a phone transition probability to the
 * allphone search. Also, when using a start word in the search, do not
 * assume a default if startword not defined.
 *
 * 12-Aug-2004	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added search_get_current_startwid().
 * 
 * Revision 1.12  2004/07/23 23:36:34  egouvea
 * Ravi's merge, with the latest fixes in the FSG code, and making the log files generated by FSG, LM, and allphone have the same 'look and feel', with the backtrace information presented consistently
 *
 * Revision 1.11  2004/07/16 00:57:11  egouvea
 * Added Ravi's implementation of FSG support.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2004/07/07 13:56:33  rkm

 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2004/06/16 18:32:28  rkm
 * Minor logformat change
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/06/16 13:47:58  rkm
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * 
 * 06-Aug-99	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added -maxwpf parameter handling to limit number of words exiting per frame.
 * 
 * 30-Oct-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Generalized the implementation of pscr based allphone.
 * 		Added phone_conf option at the end of FWDTREE search to produce pscr-based
 * 		rescoring of fwdtree result.
 * 
 * 24-Mar-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added phone perplexity measure into search_hyp_t structure hypothesis
 * 		for each utterance.
 * 
 * 08-Mar-98	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added lattice density measure into search_hyp_t structure generated
 * 		as hypothesis for each utterance.

 * 		Added search_remove_context() call in search_postprocess_bptable.
 * 
 * 03-Apr-97	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed lm_cache_reset to lm3g_cache_reset, and lm_cache_stats_dump
 * 		to lm3g_cache_stats_dump.
 * 
 * 08-Dec-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed search_hyp_t hyp[] result to contain actual frame ids.
 * 		instead of post-silence-compression ids.
 * 		Added functions search_bptbl_wordlist() and search_bptbl_pred().
 * 
 * 12-Jul-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Commented out lm_cache_reset in search_fwdflat_start().
 * 
 * 19-Jun-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Changed strings phone_active to npa (phone_active is too generic).
 * 
 * 19-Jun-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Added bestpscr[] and modified compute_phone_active() to use best phone
 * 		scores (bestpscr) returned by SCVQ.
 * 
 * 15-Jun-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 * 		Modified to always rebuild search tree when search_set_current_lm called.
 * 
 * 22-May-95	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *		Changed search_result and search_partial_result interfaces to simplify

 * dictionary size owing to dynamic addition of OOVs.
 * 
 * Revision 8.8  94/05/26  16:49:41  rkm
 * Rewrote lattice rescoring non-recursively to reduce LM thrashing,
 * and moved that code to a separate file.  Moved some data structure
 * declaration (BPTBL_T) to search.h.
 * 
 * Revision 8.7  94/05/19  14:21:36  rkm
 * Reordered LM accesses in last_phone_transition and word_transition for
 * greater efficiency.
 * 
 * Revision 8.6  94/05/10  10:48:43  rkm
 * Changed various list memory management routines to use the generic
 * listelem_alloc() and listelem_free() functions.
 * Added last_ltrans array for caching the best LM score info during
 * last_phone_transition().
 * 
 * Revision 8.5  94/04/22  13:56:30  rkm
 * Added search_hyp_t for collecting output hypothesis-related info in
 * one place.  Directed output of both passes to this structure, so the
 * match file will contain the final result.
 * 
 * Revision 8.4  94/04/14  14:43:52  rkm
 * Added optional second pass for lattice-rescoring.
 * Added option to dump forward pass bptable for postprocessing.

 * Added multiple start words for the LISTEN project.
 * Corrected minor error in statistics gathering.
 * 
 * Revision 1.13  94/02/03  18:38:12  rkm
 * Fixed debugging and tracing code.
 * 
 * Revision 1.12  94/02/01  10:46:54  rkm
 * Mark active senones only if topN=4; otherwise SCVQ computes all senone scores.
 * 
 * Revision 1.11  94/02/01  10:23:02  rkm
 * Lookup trigram LM values through trigram LM cache instead of directly.
 *

 * 
 * Revision 1.9  94/01/25  12:36:45  rkm

 * 
 * Revision 1.8  94/01/24  10:01:38  rkm
 * Include LM score when entering last phone of any word, rather than on
 * exiting word.  Special case for handling single-phone words.
 * 
 * Revision 1.7  94/01/21  15:22:10  rkm

 * 
 * Revision 1.6  94/01/21  15:06:45  rkm

 * 
 * Revision 1.5  94/01/21  13:47:48  rkm
