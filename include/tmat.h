 * HISTORY
 * $Log: tmat.h,v $
 * Revision 1.1.1.1  2006/05/23 18:45:03  dhuggins
 * re-importation
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2005/09/29 21:51:19  dhuggins
 * Add support for Sphinx3 tmat files.  Amazingly enough, it Just Works
 * (but it isn't terribly robust)
 *
 * Revision 1.9  2005/06/21 19:23:35  arthchan2003
 * 1, Fixed doxygen documentation. 2, Added $ keyword.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2005/06/13 04:02:56  archan
 * Fixed most doxygen-style documentation under libs3decoder.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2005/05/03 04:09:09  archan
 * Implemented the heart of word copy search. For every ci-phone, every word end, a tree will be allocated to preserve its pathscore.  This is different from 3.5 or below, only the best score for a particular ci-phone, regardless of the word-ends will be preserved at every frame.  The graph propagation will not collect unused word tree at this point. srch_WST_propagate_wd_lv2 is also as the most stupid in the century.  But well, after all, everything needs a start.  I will then really get the results from the search and see how it looks.
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2005/04/21 23:50:26  archan
 * Some more refactoring on the how reporting of structures inside kbcore_t is done, it is now 50% nice. Also added class-based LM test case into test-decode.sh.in.  At this moment, everything in search mode 5 is already done.  It is time to test the idea whether the search can really be used.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2005/03/30 01:22:47  archan
 * Fixed mistakes in last updates. Add
 *
 * 
 * 20.Apr.2001  RAH (rhoughton@mediasite.com, ricky.houghton@cs.cmu.edu)
 *              Added tmat_free to free allocated memory 
 *
 * 29-Feb-2000	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
 * 		Added tmat_chk_1skip(), and made tmat_chk_uppertri() public.
 * 
 * 10-Dec-1999	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
 * 		Added tmat_dump().
 * 
 * 11-Mar-97	M K Ravishankar (rkm@cs.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University.
 * 		Started based on original S3 implementation.
